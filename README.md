# Python Basics

This repository contains code examples and exercises for learning the basics of Python programming. The materials are aimed at beginners who have little or no prior experience with Python or programming in general.

## Getting Started

To use the materials in this repository, you should have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once you have Python installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine using Git:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-basics.git
```
Alternatively, you can download a ZIP archive of the repository and extract it to a local folder.

## Contents

The repository contains the following directories:

- `examples`: Code examples that demonstrate various Python concepts and features.
- `exercises`: Practice exercises for applying the concepts learned in the examples.
- `solutions`: Sample solutions for the exercises (provided for reference only).
- `tests`: Automated tests for the exercises (requires pytest library).

## Usage

You can run the example scripts by executing the Python interpreter with the filename as an argument:
```
python examples/hello_world.py
```
You can run the exercises by editing the files in the `exercises` directory and running the corresponding test script in the `tests` directory:
```
python tests/test_hello_world.py
```
The tests will check if your code produces the expected output for each exercise.

## Contributing

If you find a bug or have a suggestion for improving the materials, you can create an issue on the [GitHub repository page](https://github.com/your-username/python-basics/issues). You can also submit a pull request if you want to contribute code changes.
